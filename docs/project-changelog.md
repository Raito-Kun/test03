# Project Changelog

All significant changes, features, and fixes to the CRM Omnichannel project are documented here.

## Version 1.3.10 (2026-04-21, rev 2) - RBAC Permission Dedup + Recording Delete

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev)
**Phase**: Permission model simplification + enforcement fixes

### RBAC Permission Deduplication

**Merged 16 Legacy Keys into Modern `resource.action` Format**:
- **Legacy plural forms removed**: `manage_campaigns`, `manage_users`, `manage_permissions`, `manage_tickets`, `manage_contacts`, `manage_leads`, `manage_debt_cases`, `manage_extensions`, `view_reports`, `view_dashboard`, `view_recordings`, `export_excel`, `make_calls`, `import_campaigns`, `import_contacts`, `import_leads`
- **Modern keys introduced** (2026-04-21): `campaign.import`, `crm.leads.import`, `switchboard.make_call`, `system.*` family, `ticket.manage`, `crm.contacts.*`, `report.*` family (view_own, view_team, view_all, export)
- **Single source of truth**: `packages/backend/prisma/seed.ts` lines 130-193 (permissionDefs array). 40+ keys across 7 groups.
- **Permission matrix UI now shows exactly 7 groups** (was 12+ with duplicates): switchboard, crm, campaign, report, ticket, qa, system

### Permission Enforcement Fixes

**`ticket.delete` — Middleware Enforcement**:
- **Before**: Hardcoded role check in `ticket-service.ts::deleteTicket` — if role !== 'admin' | 'super_admin', throw error
- **After**: Middleware `requirePermission('ticket.delete')` applied to `DELETE /api/tickets/:id` route
- **Default grant**: super_admin, admin roles; revokable per role via matrix UI

**`crm.contacts.delete` — Middleware Enforcement**:
- **Before**: No enforcement; any authenticated user could call `DELETE /contacts/:id`
- **After**: Middleware `requirePermission('crm.contacts.delete')` on both `DELETE /contacts/:id` + `POST /contacts/bulk-delete`
- **Default grant**: super_admin, admin, manager roles

**`recording.delete` — NEW Permission**:
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/call-logs/:id/recording` (new)
- **Label**: Xoá ghi âm
- **Group**: switchboard
- **Default grant**: super_admin, admin roles
- **Purpose**: Allow admin/super_admin to purge call recordings from disk + database
- **Security hardening** (post code-review):
  - Cluster scope enforced — non-super_admin cannot delete another tenant's recording
  - Path-escape guard — `path.resolve` compared against `RECORDINGS_DIR`, rejects `..` traversal or poisoned absolute paths
  - Audit log entry written via `logAudit('delete', 'call_log_recording', …)` on every successful purge

### Schema & Migration

- **Migration**: `packages/backend/prisma/migrations/20260421211700_rbac_dedup/`
- **Idempotent rename**: UPDATE `permissions SET key=newKey WHERE key=oldKey` preserves all existing grants
- **Zero-loss migration**: All role grants converted atomically; no grant deletion
- **Post-deploy cache bust**: Run `DEL permissions:role:*` in Redis to force reload on next request

### Files Modified

- `packages/backend/prisma/seed.ts` — permissionDefs array (130-193): 7 groups, 40+ keys, parent-child hierarchy
- `packages/backend/prisma/migrations/20260421211700_rbac_dedup/migration.sql` — idempotent key rename
- `packages/backend/src/routes/ticket-routes.ts` — added `requirePermission('ticket.delete')` to DELETE endpoint
- `packages/backend/src/routes/contact-routes.ts` — added `requirePermission('crm.contacts.delete')` to DELETE + bulk-delete
- `packages/backend/src/routes/call-log-routes.ts` — added new `DELETE /call-logs/:id/recording` endpoint with `recording.delete` permission
- `.claude/skills/crm-permission/SKILL.md` — updated "Naming convention" + anti-patterns section
- `docs/codebase-summary.md` — updated permission table with 7 groups and 40+ keys
- `docs/system-architecture.md` — permission section updated (if present)

## Version 1.3.10 (2026-04-21) - Call Log UX Refresh + CDR Billsec Invariant + Ticket Ext Search

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev)
**Phase**: Call-logs operational UX polish + data integrity

### Call History (`/call-logs`) — column semantics corrected
- **"Lý do SIP" column** — now English short labels (`Answered`/`Busy`/`No answer`/`Cancelled`/`Rejected`/`Voicemail`/`Not found`/`Timeout`/`Server error`/`Unavailable`). Top-level "Kết quả" remains Vietnamese. Reason: grep-ability against FreeSWITCH logs + SIP vendor docs; sub-reasons stay protocol-English by convention.
- **"Phân loại" column** — removed disposition-leak bug (was showing "Đã liên hệ"/"Hứa trả 1 phần" in call-type column). Now strictly one of `Manual`/`Click2call`/`Autocall`/`Callbot` derived from `call_logs.notes`. Filter dropdown + backend `callType` filter extended with `callbot`.
- **"Trạng thái" column (new)** — disposition code (Vietnamese label). Inline-editable via shadcn Select; `POST /call-logs/:id/disposition` updates. Tooltip shows "Cập nhật bởi {user} lúc {time}".
- **Disposition filter (new)** — dropdown "Tất cả trạng thái" in toolbar filters by disposition code id (backend `disposition` param, already supported).

### Disposition audit trail
- Schema: added `call_logs.disposition_set_by_user_id` (FK users) + `disposition_set_at` (timestamp) for fast list-view lookup. Full change history remains in `audit_logs` (entity_type=`call_logs`, action=`update`, changes={previous, next, reason}).
- Migration: `20260421183000_add_disposition_set_by`.
- Service: `setCallDisposition` captures previous disposition, populates who/when, logs enhanced audit payload; no longer overwrites `notes` (that column stores the call-source tag).

### CDR merge — billsec invariant fix
- **Bug**: Busy/No-answer/Cancelled/Voicemail calls sometimes inherited non-zero billsec from a parallel leg during CDR webhook merge. UI showed misleading talk-time on unanswered calls; Excel exports likewise.
- **Root cause**: `mergeBillsec` fell back to `MAX(candidate, existing)` when `answerTime` was null, preserving spurious leg values.
- **Fix**: `packages/backend/src/lib/cdr-merge.ts` — added invariant `if (!answerTime) return 0`. Unit test updated: `answerTime=null` now expects billsec=0.
- **Backfill**: 61 legacy rows on dev had `answer_time IS NULL AND billsec > 0`; reset to 0 via one-shot SQL; verified 0 rows remain leaked.

### Ticket Kanban UX
- Card row 2 label: `#{ext}` → `Tạo: #{ext}` + tooltip "Extension người tạo". Clearer intent.
- Search bar placeholder: "Tìm KH hoặc số điện thoại..." → "Tìm KH / SĐT / Ext...". Filter logic extended to also match `agentExt`.

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` — +2 fields on `CallLog`, named `User` relations (CallLogAgent, CallLogDispositionSetBy)
- `packages/backend/prisma/migrations/20260421183000_add_disposition_set_by/` (new)
- `packages/backend/src/services/call-log-service.ts` — list select includes `dispositionSetBy`/`dispositionSetAt`
- `packages/backend/src/services/disposition-code-service.ts` — populate who/when, enhanced audit
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/call-log-controller.ts` — `callType` union extended with `callbot`
- `packages/backend/src/lib/cdr-merge.ts` — billsec invariant
- `packages/backend/tests/cdr-merge.test.ts` — updated expectation
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/call-logs/call-log-list.tsx` — all column + filter changes
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/tickets/ticket-card.tsx`, `ticket-list.tsx`, `use-ticket-kanban.ts` — ext label + search

## Version 1.3.9 (2026-04-21) - SIP Presence Cross-Tenant Fix + Ticket Kanban MVP

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev, backend updated)
**Phase**: Phase 20+ (SIP presence fix + Ticket Kanban feature)
**Status**: Shipped — SIP presence deployed, Ticket Kanban MVP complete

### SIP Presence Cross-Tenant Fix

**Symptom**: Extension 105 on domain `hoangthienfinance.vn` showed as online in `blueva` tenant's dashboard and monitoring UI, despite being on a different cluster.

**Root Cause**: `sip-presence-service.ts` queried FreeSWITCH `sip_registrations` table and SQLite `sofia_reg_*.db` databases without filtering by `sip_realm`. One PBX host (10.10.101.206) serves multiple FusionPBX domains; when querying registrations, both domains' extensions appeared in the results. The query and the frontend map then displayed all registrations to all tenants.

**Fix**: 
- `packages/backend/src/services/sip-presence-service.ts` — Added required `sipDomain` parameter to `queryRegistrations` method. Both PostgreSQL query (reads `sip_realm`) and SQLite path now filter by `sip_realm = domain_name`.
- `packages/backend/src/jobs/sip-presence-job.ts` — Refactored to iterate per-cluster per-domain pair. Each cluster's job loop now fetches the `sip_domain` from the `PbxCluster` record and passes it to the service. Prevents cross-tenant leakage.
- Audit: WebLogs or webhook history shows the fix was applied 2026-04-21 14:00 UTC.

**Impact**: Agents on hoangthienfinance.vn no longer see blueva's extensions, and vice versa.

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/backend/src/services/sip-presence-service.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/jobs/sip-presence-job.ts`

### Ticket Kanban + C2C Integration (MVP Complete)

**Feature**: Redesigned Ticket Management page as a Kanban-style board supporting 4-column workflow (Chưa xử lý, Đang xử lý, Đã xử lý, Đã đóng) with drag-drop status updates, detail dialog with waveform and click-to-call, and delete restricted to admin/super_admin only.

**Backend Changes**:
- `packages/backend/src/models/Ticket.ts` — added `clusterId` field (enforced on create, scoped per cluster)
- `packages/backend/src/services/ticket-service.ts` — `deleteTicket` restricted to admin/super_admin roles
- `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id` — response now includes `callLog` and `auditLog` nested objects for detail view
- Permission: delete ticket (admin/super_admin only)

**Frontend Changes**:
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/tickets/ticket-kanban.tsx` — NEW, renders 4-column board with drag-drop via dnd-kit
- `packages/frontend/src/components/ticket-detail-dialog.tsx` — Enhanced with waveform player (if callLogId present), click-to-call button, resolved dialog requiring resultCode
- `packages/frontend/src/components/ticket-kanban-card.tsx` — Compact card view with ticket title, assigned agent, priority badge
- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/use-ticket-drag.ts` — Handles drag-drop state updates via API

**API Enhancements**:
- `PUT /api/v1/tickets/:id` — Accepts `status` updates with validation (open→in_progress→resolved→closed)
- Resolved status requires `resultCode` and optional `resolutionNote`
- Delete: `DELETE /api/v1/tickets/:id` — super_admin/admin only

**Success Criteria**:
- 4 column headers visible (Vietnamese labels)
- Drag ticket card → API PATCH updates persisted
- Resolved status requires resultCode dialog
- Delete button visible only to admin/super_admin
- Detail dialog includes waveform + click-to-call

## Version 1.3.8 (2026-04-17) - Multi-Rule Dialplan Selection for Preflight

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev, backend `c0e3fdc6ab42`, frontend `34e2df8d49bc`)
**Phase**: Phase 20 (Telephony polish)
**Status**: Shipped — migration applied, 29/29 unit tests pass

### Why

Preflight's `recording_dialplan` check was hardcoded to look up `dialplan_name = 'outbound'`. FusionPBX admins route outbound through carrier-specific rules (`OUT-VIETTEL`, `OUT-MOBI`, `OUT-VINA`, etc.) — so the check fired on wrong names or missed tenants that don't use "outbound" as a literal name.

### What

**Schema** — `packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`:
- New column `outboundDialplanNames String[] @default([])` on `PbxCluster`. Migration `20260417210500_add_outbound_dialplan_names`, additive, existing rows default to empty array.

**Backend** — per-rule check + dropdown endpoint:
- `packages/backend/src/lib/pbx-dialplan-detect.ts` — new pure helper `aggregateRuleStatuses` aggregates per-rule detection into pass/warn/fail with copy-hint. Tested in isolation.
- `packages/backend/src/services/pbx-preflight-service.ts::checkRecordingDialplan` — iterates selected rules via `ANY($2::text[])`, delegates aggregation to the helper.
- `packages/backend/src/services/pbx-preflight-service.ts::listClusterDialplans` — NEW, lists enabled dialplans for a cluster's domain.
- `GET /api/v1/clusters/:id/dialplans` — populates the UI checkbox list.
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/cluster-controller.ts` — Zod schema accepts `outboundDialplanNames: z.array(z.string()).optional()`.

**Frontend** — multi-select picker:
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/settings/cluster-dialplan-picker.tsx` — NEW. Checkbox list with "Nạp danh sách" button (loads from new endpoint), warns when saved rules no longer exist in FusionPBX.
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/settings/cluster-detail-form.tsx` — wires picker under FusionPBX PG creds section in SSH tab.

### Status Semantics

- All selected rules have 6/6 actions → `pass`
- Mix of OK + failing → `warn` (not blocking — e.g., emergency-only rules may intentionally skip recording)
- Zero OK → `fail` (blocks activation)
- Empty selection → `skipped` with hint "Chọn ít nhất 1 rule"

### Tests

- `packages/backend/tests/pbx-preflight.test.ts` — extended to 15 tests (5 new aggregator cases: all-ok, mix-warn, all-fail, missing-rule, empty-defensive). 29/29 across all pure unit tests pass.

### Data Preservation

Existing clusters unaffected — new column defaults to `[]`. Preflight shows `skipped` for them until admin opts in via the picker.

### Plan

## Version 1.3.7 (2026-04-17) - Cross-Tenant Data Leak Fix

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev, image SHA `08c5d357b93f`)
**Phase**: Phase 20 (Security hotfix)
**Status**: Shipped — dev verified
**Severity**: High (data visibility across tenants for super_admin)

### Problem

super_admin users who switched into another tenant (e.g. `hoangthienfinance.vn`) still saw `blueva` data on list endpoints — contacts, leads, call logs, debt cases, campaigns, users, agent monitor.

### Root Cause

`resolveListClusterFilter` in `packages/backend/src/lib/active-cluster.ts` discarded the role and trusted the JWT's `userClusterId` claim, which was frozen at login to the user's home cluster (blueva for that super_admin). `switchCluster` flipped `pbx_clusters.isActive` atomically in the DB but never re-issued the JWT, so for the next 15 minutes every list request scoped to blueva regardless of the tenant they had "switched to".

Full report: `plans/reports/debugger-260417-2020-cross-tenant-leak.md`.

### Fix

`packages/backend/src/lib/active-cluster.ts:27-42` — role-aware branch:
- super_admin → read `pbx_clusters.isActive` from the DB (ignores stale JWT)
- everyone else → keep trusting the JWT (regular users can't switch)

Also extended `monitoring-service.ts::getAgentStatuses` to accept `userRole` and call the fixed helper; `monitoring-routes.ts` now passes `req.user?.role`.

### Data Preservation

Read-only logic change. No DB row touched. Records already stamped with wrong cluster (create-paths still use `getActiveClusterId` without role) are unaffected by this patch.

### Tests

- `packages/backend/tests/cluster-filter.test.ts` — 7/7 pass. Covers:
  - super_admin reads DB active, not JWT
  - super_admin gets null when no cluster active (prevents seeing all tenants)
  - agent/leader/admin/undefined roles keep using JWT, don't hit DB
  - fallback when JWT has no clusterId

### Follow-up / Unresolved

- **Create-paths (`getActiveClusterId`) still use JWT** — a super_admin viewing tenant X but creating a contact/lead/campaign may stamp it with their home cluster. Same root cause, separate call sites. Tracked for v1.3.8.
- **JWT invalidation on switch** — `switchCluster` should force re-issue; current workaround is the DB-backed filter.
- **Dashboard + report services** use `buildScopeWhere` path, not affected by this fix.

### Files Modified

- `packages/backend/src/lib/active-cluster.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/services/monitoring-service.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/routes/monitoring-routes.ts`
- `packages/backend/tests/cluster-filter.test.ts` — NEW

## Version 1.3.6 (2026-04-17) - PBX Preflight Tab

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev, image SHA `2e8aa108e25b`)
**Phase**: Phase 20 (Telephony polish)
**Status**: Shipped — migration applied, tests pass

### Why

Prevent the silent misconfig that caused the 2026-04-17 blueva-recording miss. When a new PBX cluster or tenant domain is declared, admin now has a one-click "Tiền kiểm" (Preflight) tab that runs 7 read-only checks and reports pass/fail with actionable hints.

### What

**Schema** — `packages/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`:
- 5 nullable fields on `PbxCluster`: `fusionpbxPgHost/Port/User/Password/Database`. Migration `20260417195500_add_fusionpbx_pg_fields` adds the columns (additive, no data migration).

**Backend** — new service + helper + route:
- `packages/backend/src/services/pbx-preflight-service.ts` — 7 read-only checks:
  ESL, SSH, PBX domain existence, recording dialplan keywords, webhook IP whitelist, recording proxy reachable, extension count. Each check timed at 10s. Runs in parallel via `Promise.all`.
- `packages/backend/src/lib/pbx-dialplan-detect.ts` — pure helper `detectRecordingActions(xml)` extracted for testing.
- `POST /api/v1/clusters/:id/preflight` — super_admin/admin only, returns `{ checks: [...], allRequiredPass: bool }`.
- `packages/backend/src/services/cluster-service.ts` — masks new `fusionpbxPgPassword` field on read, strips MASK on update.
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/cluster-controller.ts` — Zod schema accepts the 5 new optional fields.

**Frontend** — new tab + field group:
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/settings/cluster-preflight-tab.tsx` — results table with Vietnamese labels + actionable hints linking to skill `crm-pbx-onboard`.
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/settings/cluster-detail-form.tsx` — new "Tiền kiểm" tab (disabled on new/unsaved cluster) + FusionPBX PG credentials group under SSH tab.
- `packages/frontend/src/pages/settings/cluster-management.tsx` — EMPTY_CLUSTER defaults.

### Safety

All checks are **read-only** — `SELECT` against FusionPBX Postgres, ESL `api version`, SSH `echo ok`, HTTP HEAD on recording proxy. No mutations to FusionPBX or CRM DB. Existing clusters without PG creds see `skipped` status for PG-dependent checks, not errors.

### Tests

- `packages/backend/tests/pbx-preflight.test.ts` — 10/10 pass. Covers `detectRecordingActions` (full/partial/empty/nullish/compact XML) and `isPbxIpAllowed` (exact/wildcard/trim).

### Plan

`plans/260417-1950-pbx-preflight-wizard/` — 6 phases, all completed.

## Version 1.3.5 (2026-04-17) - Call History Timing & Recording Fix

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (dev, image SHA `99d464188dc5`)
**Phase**: Phase 20 (Telephony polish)
**Status**: Shipped — dev verified

### Problem

- `Thời gian nói` (billsec) stuck at `0:02` for every C2C outbound call regardless of real talk time.
- `Thời lượng` (duration) also truncated (e.g. 10s shown for a 22s call).
- Recording icon missing on all calls from the `blueva` tenant.

### Root Cause

- **Timing**: FusionPBX emits multiple CDR legs per call. The only non-skipped leg (loopback-B) reports `billsec = 2` (handoff overhead) and `duration = 10` (loopback channel lifetime). The real talk-time datapoints live on the `sofia/internal/101` agent-SIP leg (`duration = 23s`, real hangup time) — that leg was being skipped entirely on the premise its timing was "inflated". The real customer talk time = `agent.endTime − loopback.answerTime`.
- **Recording**: OUT-ALL dialplan on the `crm` FusionPBX domain had recording actions (March 2026 fix), but the `blueva` domain's OUT-ALL was never patched — no `record_path`, `record_name`, or `record_session=true` actions → FreeSWITCH never started recording.

### Fix

**Backend** — `packages/backend/src/controllers/webhook-controller.ts`:
- Agent-SIP leg (`sofia/internal/<ext>`) no longer discarded. It now merges `duration = MAX(agent.duration, existing)` and computes `billsec = agent.endTime − existing.answerTime` into the canonical row.
- Canonical upsert (loopback-B path) also applies the same cross-leg formula when it arrives after the agent leg, so both leg arrival orderings converge on the same result.
- `startTime`/`answerTime`/`endTime` conversions hoisted up so both branches share them.

**Infra** — FusionPBX PBX `10.10.101.206`:
- Added recording action block (`record_path`, `record_name`, `mkdir`, `RECORD_ANSWER_REQ`, `api_on_answer=uuid_record`, `sip_h_accountcode`) to `blueva` domain's OUT-ALL dialplan (`v_dialplans.dialplan_xml`, UUID `263e6335-6df6-44a3-a431-f6fba7e762a8`).
- Backup: `/root/blueva_dialplan_backup_20260417_1849.csv`.
- Cache flushed (`xml_flush_cache`) and `reloadxml` executed.

### Deployment Note

Prior deploy only `docker restart`-ed the `crm-backend` container. The container's `/app/` is baked into the image (not bind-mounted), so new code never ran. Correct flow: `rsync → docker compose build backend → up -d backend`. Verification: `grep -c "Agent SIP leg merged" /app/.../webhook-controller.js` inside container returns `1`.

### Data Preservation

No rows in `call_logs` modified or deleted. Manual calls (via `/call-logs/manual` route, `callUuid` prefix `manual-`) bypass the webhook entirely and are unaffected. Old CDR rows keep their incorrect billsec; only calls made after this deploy get correct values.

### Files Modified

- `packages/backend/src/controllers/webhook-controller.ts` — cross-leg billsec merge
- FusionPBX `v_dialplans` (blueva domain, OUT-ALL) — recording actions
- `plans/reports/debugger-260417-1836-billsec-and-recording.md` — evidence + decisions
- `.claude/skills/crm-pbx-cluster/SKILL.md` — added CDR leg semantics note
- `packages/backend/tests/call-logs-comprehensive.test.ts` — cross-leg merge test

## Version 1.3.4 (2026-04-16) - Login Stability & Contact Import Wizard (WIP)

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207 (login fix LIVE; import wizard frontend in progress)  
**Phase**: Phase 20 (Auth Hardening & Import Enhancement)  
**Status**: Partial (login fix shipped, wizard frontend being built in parallel)

### Auth Stability Fix

- **Cross-Tab Refresh Race**: Implemented Redis replay cache (`refresh:replay:{id}`, TTL 10s) to prevent duplicate access token generation during simultaneous /refresh calls on multiple browser tabs.
- **Per-Email Rate Limiting**: Migrated rate limiter from IP-based to email-based keying (default 10→30/min) to prevent false-positives on shared corporate networks.
- **E2E Test Coverage**: Added `e2e/auth-refresh-race.test.ts` validating 5 concurrent /refresh calls return identical access token and per-email rate limits; 9/9 tests passing.

### Contact Import 3-Step Wizard (WIP)

- **Backend Complete**: Implemented 3 new API endpoints (`/contacts/import/preview`, `/check-dedup`, `/commit`) + wizard service layer for parse, dedup, and action handling.
- **Dedup & Actions**: Phone-based deduplication with per-row actions (keep, overwrite, merge, skip) and bulk "Tự động gộp trùng" button.
- **Agent Allocation**: Extended `/data-allocation/agents` endpoint with `onlineOnly=true` filter; Step 3 supports random (round-robin) or manual per-row agent assignment.
- **Frontend In Progress**: 5 new components being built (preview, dedup, assign, types, orchestrator) + contact-list integration; target completion 2026-04-17.

### Files Modified

**Backend (Auth Fix)**:
- `packages/backend/src/services/auth-service.ts` — Redis replay cache in refresh flow
- `packages/backend/src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts` — Email-keyed rate limiter
- `e2e/auth-refresh-race.test.ts` — NEW: Concurrent refresh race test suite

**Backend (Import Wizard)**:

## Version 1.3.3 (2026-04-08) - Feature Toggle System

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207
**Phase**: Phase 19 (Feature Management)
**Status**: Deployed

### Features

#### Dynamic Feature Flags (Cluster & Domain-Level)
- New `ClusterFeatureFlag` table: cluster-scoped feature toggles with optional domain-level overrides
- Unique constraint: (cluster_id, domain_name, feature_key) ensures single control point per feature
- 20+ feature keys: contacts, leads, debt, campaigns, tickets, voip_c2c, recording, cdr_webhook, live_monitoring, call_history, reports_*, ai_*, team_management, permission_matrix, pbx_cluster_mgmt

#### Backend API
- `GET /api/v1/feature-flags?clusterId=` — List all flags for cluster (super_admin only)
- `PUT /api/v1/feature-flags` — Bulk update flags (super_admin only)
- `GET /api/v1/feature-flags/effective` — Get effective flags for current user's cluster (all auth users)
- New middleware: `checkFeatureEnabled(featureKey)` — returns 403 when feature disabled
- Applied to routes: 13 route files (contacts, leads, debt-cases, campaigns, tickets, calls, call-logs, monitoring, reports, ai, teams, permissions, export)

#### Frontend
- New "Tính năng" tab in cluster detail form with toggle grid per module
- Domain-level tabs support (Toàn cụm + per-domain)
- `FeatureGuard` component blocks direct URL access with friendly message
- Sidebar hides menu items when features are disabled
- `useFeatureFlags` hook for fetching effective flags with caching

#### Hierarchy & Behavior
- Cluster-level flag (domainName="") acts as master override
- If cluster disables a feature, all domains cannot use it
- Domain-level flags allow per-domain customization
- Lookup order: domain-specific flag first, fallback to cluster-level
- super_admin bypasses feature checks completely

**Deployment**: 10.10.101.207
**Phase**: Phase 18 (Extension Sync & Account Management)
**Status**: Deployed

### Features

#### Extension Sync via SSH
- New `extension-sync-service.ts`: connects to FusionPBX host via SSH (ssh2), queries `v_extensions` table from PostgreSQL, upserts results into `ClusterExtension` table
- Triggered via `POST /api/v1/clusters/:id/sync-extensions`
- Handles SSH key auth (reads `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`) with 20s timeout fallback
- Returns `{ synced: N }` with success/error toast in UI

#### Account Management Page
- Cluster detail form (`cluster-detail-form.tsx`) includes extensions tab listing synced extensions
- `cluster-management.tsx` updated with cluster selector and extension count display
- Admins can view all synced extensions per cluster with caller name and accountcode
- Extension list refreshes after each sync operation

#### Permission Matrix English Role Names
- `permission-matrix-table.tsx`: role column headers now display English names alongside Vietnamese
- Role labels: super_admin → "Super Admin", admin → "Admin", manager → "Manager", leader → "Leader", qa → "QA", agent_telesale → "Agent Telesale", agent_collection → "Agent Collection"
- `role-tab-panel.tsx`: consistent role display across settings tabs

#### Data Isolation Fixes
- All service queries now filter by active `clusterId` where applicable
- `contact-service.ts`, `lead-service.ts`, `debt-case-service.ts`, `call-log-service.ts`: scoped to cluster
- `campaign-service.ts`: cluster-scoped list and create operations
- `user-service.ts`: cluster-scoped user listing for extension assignment

#### Contact Form Improvements
- Province/district dropdowns added to `contact-form.tsx` (replaces free-text address fields)
- `contact-detail-dialog.tsx`: dialog width increased for better readability (max-w-4xl)
- Consistent dialog sizing across contact create and edit flows

#### Cluster UI Cleanup
- Removed connectivity status banner from cluster list view (`cluster-management.tsx`)
- Updated pill color scheme: active cluster → green, inactive → gray, error → red

#### New 3-Tab Structure

**Tab 1: Tóm tắt (Summary)**
- Sub-tabs: "Theo nhân viên" (by agent) and "Theo team" (by team)
- Per-agent and per-team call statistics with columns: Name/Team, Total Calls, Answered, No Answer, Busy, Voicemail, Duration (avg), Last Call
- CSV export for both sub-tabs
- Default sorting: by total calls descending

  3. Weekly Trend (line chart, last 12 weeks of calls)
  4. Result Distribution (pie chart, breakdown by call result)
- Responsive layout: stacks on mobile, 2×2 grid on desktop

#### Shared Filter Bar
- Located above tabs, persistent across all views
- Filters: Từ ngày (From Date), Đến ngày (To Date), Nhân viên (Agent), Team, Search button

---

## Version 1.1.1 (2026-03-27)

### CDR Deduplication Fix (Critical)
- FusionPBX sends 2-3 CDR legs per call with different UUIDs; solution uses canonical UUID from `other_loopback_leg_uuid` or time-window search to merge legs
- Skips internal SIP legs and orphans; result: 1 call = 1 row with correct duration/billsec

### Recording Sync & Localization Fixes
- Recording sync: changed from scp to rsync for reliable incremental sync
- Vietnamese dropdown filters: fixed Select component rendering across all list pages
- SIP Code as source of truth: priority over hangupCause; derives missing codes per RFC 3261
- Call source tagging: ESL sets crm_call_source variable; Frontend maps: c2c, autocall, manual, inbound
- Nginx no-cache for index.html to prevent stale chunk caching

**Files**: webhook-controller.ts, call-log-list.tsx, leads/tickets/campaigns/debt-cases lists (dropdown fixes)

## Version 1.1.0-beta (2026-03-26)

### Phase 10 & 11: RBAC & Extension Management

**Phase 10**: super_admin role with dynamic RBAC system (13 permission keys, Redis caching, Permission Manager UI)
- API: `GET /api/v1/permissions`, `PUT /api/v1/permissions/role/:role`, `GET /api/v1/permissions/user`

**Phase 11**: Extension management with SIP registration status, real-time ESL queries, extension reassignment
- API: `GET /api/v1/extensions`, `PUT /api/v1/extensions/:ext/assign`

### VoIP & C2C Integration Fixes
- Call routing: loopback bridge via domain 'crm'; ESL ACL rules; SIP URI handling; CDR parsing (form-urlencoded)
- Call log: Vietnamese UI, timezone handling, clear filters, correct field mapping, data array format
- Dashboard: Quick dial widget, C2C button for contacts/leads
